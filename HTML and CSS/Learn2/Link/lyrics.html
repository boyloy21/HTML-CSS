            It's been a long day
            Without you, my friend
            And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
            We've come a long way
            From where we began
            Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
            When I see you again

            Damn, who knew?
            All the planes we flew, good things we been through
            That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
            'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
            But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
            Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
            Those were the days, hard work forever pays
            Now I see you in a better place
            Uh

            How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
            Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
            And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

            It's been a long day
            Without you, my friend
            And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
            We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way)
            From where we began (You know where we started)
            Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (Let me tell you)
            When I see you again
